# service-less

## 1. Overview

When I started developing apps with a serverless microservices architecture, I wasn't aware of its complexity.  So for the sake of my mental health, I created this library. Based on the template provided by the AWS lambda function documentation, it consist of a simple interface for the main handler function. With the capability to execute a business logic per request method.

Other features are:

1. One or more settings reading from a customÂ configuration file.
2. Request method whitelist through an access control system.
3. Payload body parsing from the event source (a JSON document sent from the trigger source, like AWS API Gateway).
4. C.O.R.S headers validation.
5. Response data mapping to the corresponding resource schema.
6. Standard application/json response on a error/exception.

## 2. Getting started

### Configuration

The following list the available settings:

- HTTP_METHODS - _default: `['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE', 'HEAD']`_
- HTTP_CONTENT_TYPE - _default: `'application/json'`_
- CORS_HEADERS - _default: `['Content-Type', 'X-Amz-Date', 'Authorization', 'X-Api-Key', 'x-requested-with']`_
- CORS_ORIGINS - _default: `'*'`_
- CORS_X_REQUEST - _default: `'*'`_

C.O.R.S headers:

- Content-Type
- X-Amz-Date
- Authorization
- X-Api-Key
- x-requested-with

### Request Routing

Import the __route__ deocorator.

```python
from svrless import route
```

Then, define a handler function for each CRUD operation business logic with the __route__ decorator.

Following the naming convention __`{http-method}_handler()`__, changing the `{http-method}` for any in the whitelist. For example:

In a new file named `config.py` whitelist the GET and POST methods.

```python
HTTP_METHODS=['GET', 'POST']
```

Then define in the `main.py` define the handler functions:

__GET request__.

```python
@route
def get_handler():
    return ("Hello World", 200)
```

__POST request__.

```python
@route
def post_handler(payload):
    return ("Hello World", 200)
```

> __NOTE!__ The expected response object must be a tuple of is a tuple `(JSON-serializable-object, int(HTTP-code[2xx, 4xx, 5xx]))`.

This is the only step needed for the method handler. The system registers the function and calls it on runtime.

### Main Handler Function

Import the __lambda_func__ deocorator.

```python
from svrless import route, lambda_func
```

For this function implement as following using the __lambda_func__ decorator. A request(event source) object and the request method handler function are passed as arguments.

For example, for a post request, we can pass the body payload b

```python
@lambda_func
def lambda_handler(request, handler):
    if request.is_post():
        return handler(request.get_payload())
    return handler()
```

## 3. Test

In a new file __`test.py`__ add the following code:

```python
response = lambda_handler({
    "resource": "/url/path",
    "path": "/url/path",
    "httpMethod": "POST",
    "headers": {
        "Accept": "application/json, text/javascript, */*; q=0.01",
        "Accept-Encoding": "gzip, deflate, br",
        "Accept-Language": "es-xl",
        "allow": "*",
    },
    "body": "{\"key\":\"tok_434rx43xsd3\"}"
}, {})

print(response)
```

Then execute __`python test.py`__. 

__output:__

```console
{
    "statusCode": 200,
    "body": "{...}",
    "headers":
    {
        "X-Requested-With": "*",
        "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*",
        "Access-Control-Allow-Headers": "Content-Type,X-Amz-Date,Authorization,X-Api-Key,x-requested-with",
        "Access-Control-Allow-Methods": "GET,POST,PUT,DELETE,HEAD",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
}
```
